Olofsson: Audiovisual Programming - Clicks and Cuts

In this course we will revisit, research and remake electronic music from the late 90s. Specifically music in the genres clicks&cuts, glitch and minimal techno. We will study the structure and form of this particular music, discuss techniques used and take a look at software packages that was popular back then. The course will also contain a lot of practical exercises. We will for example write small programs in [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) that generate sounds and rhythms similar to the minimal techno SND released on [Mille Plateaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Plateaux), code graphics in [Processing](http://processing.org) that imitates what Alva Noto used as background visuals, damage CDs with adhesive tape and razorblades in the style of Yasunao Tone, and make textures with layered looping soundfiles like found in the music of Microstoria. The course will be taught in English.
