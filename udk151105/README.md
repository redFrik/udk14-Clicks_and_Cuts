click experiments
--

first play with a battery (here a 1.5V) and a speaker element...

![battery_speaker.jpg](battery_speaker.jpg?raw=true "battery_speaker.jpg")

notice how the paper code pops out and sinks in depending on battery polarity (swap the cables around)

play with different speakers...

![speakers.jpg](speakers.jpg?raw=true "speakers.jpg")

and also try putting them into boxes...

![speaker_box.jpg](speaker_box.jpg?raw=true "speaker_box.jpg")

notice how different they all sound.

next connect a big capacitor (here 220uF) across the speaker wires (the thereby also across the battery). you should only get one click sound from the speaker. swap cables around and to get another click. the reason it only click once is because energy is stored in the capacitor and it need to be discharged first (by for example swapping the poles around) before the speaker can click again.

add a resistor (here 470ohm) in parallell to the capacitor like this...

![filter.jpg](filter.jpg?raw=true "filter.jpg")

now the click should be there each time you connect the cables, although it will sound a bit 'cleaner'. we have made a filter. the resistor will slowly drain or bleed away the energy stored in the capacitor.

```supercollider
s.boot

{LFPulse.ar(0.7)}.scope //lots of dc offset - bad for the speaker
{HPF.ar(LFPulse.ar(0.7), 9)}.scope //add a high-pass filter with 9Hz cutoff
{LeakDC.ar(LFPulse.ar(0.7))}.scope //same thing using the LeakDC filter ugen

{LFPulse.ar(0.7)}.play
{Impulse.ar(1.4)}.play
{LFSaw.ar(1.4)}.play

//starting the sound at top of the sine cycle gives a click/punch
//we can do this by setting the phase to a quarter of 2pi
{SinOsc.ar(50, 0)}.scope(fadeTime:0)
{SinOsc.ar(50, 2pi/4)}.scope(fadeTime:0)

{SinOsc.ar(50)*Line.ar(1, 0, 0.1)}.scope(fadeTime:0)
{SinOsc.ar(50, 2pi/4)*Line.ar(1, 0, 0.1)}.scope(fadeTime:0)

//some experiments with band-pass filters
{BPF.ar(LFPulse.ar(1)+LFPulse.ar(1.5), 250, 0.1, 4)}.scope
{BPF.ar(LFPulse.ar(1)+LFPulse.ar(1.5), 99, 0.1, 4)}.scope
{HPF.ar(LFPulse.ar(1)+LFPulse.ar(1.5), 9)}.scope
{BPF.ar(Impulse.ar([5, 6]), [2000, 3000], 0.1, 10)}.scope
```
